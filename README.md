# Fibonacci Lab

**This very simple self-contained Java app is:**
 - primarily meant to *demonstrate the relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden Ratio*
 - a thrown-together project for my little cousin that I hope somebody else will benefit from
 - intentionally not up to the same standards as my other projects, as it was coded in a couple of hours

## Instructions

1. Install Java 1.8+ on your machine if it isn't already. (On OS X/\*nix, ensure JAVA_HOME is defined and points to the install dir.)

2. Run the app:

   - Easy way:
     - Execute the provided `run-applet` script for your OS.
       - Windows: double-click `run-applet.bat` on ; execute the \*.sh script for )
       - OS X/\*nix: Open a terminal in the root folder, and execute: `chmod +x run-applet.sh; ./run-applet.sh`
  - Hard way:
     - Manually build the sources with `javac` and run as you want. 
     - If you don't want/have `applet-viewer` on your system (you probably do in `$JAVA_HOME/bin`), you may wish to change that `Boolean` setting in primary source file and run with the traditional `java` executable.
